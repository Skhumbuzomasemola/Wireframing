# Wireframing
write a brief introduction explaining what wireframing is and its importance in the design process
What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the practice of creating a basic visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a user interface. These are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital mockups that focus on the placement of elements such as buttons, menus, images, and text without including detailed design components like color schemes or typography.
Wireframes help illustrate how users will interact with a product and provide a foundation for further design and development.
  Why is Wireframing Important?
  Wireframing plays a crucial role in the early stages of product development. It helps teams:
  Visualize Layouts: Outline where and how elements will appear on each screen.
  Clarify User Flows: Map out the steps users take to complete tasks.
  Identify Issues Early: Spot usability or design problems before they become costly.
  Facilitate Feedback: Encourage collaboration among designers, developers, and stakeholders.
  Guide Development: Serve as a reference point for building high-fidelity designs and working prototypes.
