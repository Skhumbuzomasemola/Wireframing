# Wireframing
## What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simplified, visual layout of a user interface. It represents the basic structure and elements of a page or screen without focusing on design details such as colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes are typically low-fidelity representations that show the placement of key components like headers, navigation menus, content sections, buttons, and footers. They help designers and developers understand how information and functionality will be organized.
